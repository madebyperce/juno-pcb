## Let's get building!
### Diode
Bend both the legs of the diode sharpely against its body. Before mounting it on the board, note the marking on the diode -- **diode direction matters**. The through-hole diode will have a black marking on one side, and that side should be closest to the square hole. Insert into its slot on the front side of the board. 

Solder the legs from the back side and clip the extra lengths off.

### Switch

**Note: If you will be socketing your MCU**, solder the sockets first. If not, skip ahead to soldering the switch in.

### MCU

Fit the MCU to the outline on the back of the board, with the components facing out (i.e. visible).
