# Juno rev. 1 (aka THE SNOOT BOOPER)

Juno is a one-key macropad that can be configured using QMK. 

**The build guide is [located here](https://github.com/na-che-x/juno-pcb/blob/main/docs/buildguide.md).**

I set up my macropad to output a random string from a predefined list of strings. Because, why not?
